======


Ichigu is a card game played with a deck of 81 cards. Each card in deck is unique and has some symbols on it. Objective of the game is to find groups of three cards: ichigus. Symbols on the cards have four properties and each of them have three different values

   - Shape: Triangle, Circle, Square
   - Color: Red, Green, Blue
   - Pattern: Empty, Striped, Filled
   - Count: One, Two, Three

This totals to 81 unique cards in a deck : 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81

To make an ichigu all 3 cards must have

   - Same or different shapes
   - Same or different colors
   - Same or different patterns
   - Same or different counts

In other words, it is NOT an ichigu if you can seperate three cards into: Two ...s and one ...
